# 👋 Hi

## 🚀 About Me  
I’m Andrei, a mathematics student at the University of Oxford. I'm passionate about **computational mathematics, numerical methods, and high-performance C++ programming**, with a growing focus on **quantitative finance**. My experience spans from **low-level systems engineering at NVIDIA** to **research in numerical analysis**.

I'm currently learning about C++ using [learncpp.com](https://learncpp.com), and about operating systems from the book [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/). If you have any recommendations for books in these areas, let me know!

In my free time, I like to learn languages (I'm currently learning Mandarin Chinese), go to the gym, and try new food. My personal favourite cuisine is Malaysian.
